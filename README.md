# Android Application to Classify Dog Breeds

## 1. Train the TensorFlow Lite mode
The model was trained on [Stanford Dogs dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) which was trained on 20,580 images of 120 dog breeds.

Download the trained model and labels and store it in the assets folder.
```bash
#Path to assets directory

/lite/examples/image_classification/android/app/src/main/assets/
```

## 2. Clone the repository
Clone the [TensorFlow Lite examples](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples.git) repository on your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/examples.git
```

## 2. 

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
